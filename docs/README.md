# Documentation

This folder follows the cross-repo docs standard for the Fraud Platform org.

## Naming Standard

- Use lowercase kebab-case for markdown files.
- Use numbered lowercase folders for ordered sections.
- Avoid mixed case, spaces, and underscores in published docs.
- Keep archives and TODO/status notes local until reviewed.

## Publication Policy (Current)

Only curated docs are tracked in Git for now:

- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/codemap.md`

All other local docs remain untracked until the docs reorg is finalized.
